I have tried to recreate the Google Chrome no internet game in Java.
It is not perfect, but I think it is actually pretty good.

This is the entire project file, so most of the XML stuff is autogenerated.
Everything else I created myself.

There are several ways to run the game, and what you do depends on the IDE you
use.

If you want to run it from the command line, the class files are located in
out/production/DinoGame/me/dinogame/

You can also compile all .java files in the me.dinogame package in the src file.

Finally, there is also a JAR file you can run located in:
out/artifacts/

To start the game once you have opened the application, simply click on the screen
or press the space bar or the up button.

To jump the dino, press space or up, to duck, press down.
